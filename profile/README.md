## James Dempsey and the Breakpoints

James Dempsey and the Breakpoints is a nerdy, nerdy band performing humorous, original songs about software development, including favorites from their #5 Billboard-charting comedy album Backtrace. This year marks the 10th LIVE near WWDC concert, making the show a true WWDC-week tradition.

James is a fifteen-year Apple veteran gone indie as an iOS and macOS developer, trainer, speaker, and songwriter. The Breakpoints are a fabled group of talented techies-by-day and musicians-by-night who help bring these songs to life.
